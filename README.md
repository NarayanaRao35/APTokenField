Introduction
------------
APTokenField is a class that behaves similarly to the 'To:' field in iOS's MFMailComposeViewController. Similar functionality can be found in [Three20] [three20]'s `TTPickerTextField`, but it's hard to use and requires integrating the entire Three20 framework into your app... so this is better :-). APTokenField has been tested on iOS 4.0 and and later (including iPad), and the code is released under the BSD 3-clause license. To find out more, check out the [project homepage] [homepage].

Getting Started
---------------
1. Add `APTokenField.h` and `APTokenField.m` into your project.
2. Add the `CoreGraphics` and `QuartzCore` frameworks to your project.
3. Create an object that conforms to the `APTokenFieldDataSource` protocol to use as the data source for your `APTokenField` instance.
4. Create an instance of an `APTokenField`, assign your `APTokenFieldDataSource` to it's `tokenFieldDataSoure` property then add the token field to your view hierarchy.
